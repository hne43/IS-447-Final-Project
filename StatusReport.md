Accuracy: To check the accuracy of the dataset, an external source was used. https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/measures/Obesity/IL shows that the obesity rate of adults in Illinois was 36%. And, in the dataset, the obesity rate of adults in Illinois was 33.89%. It was not the same as the external source, however, it can be considered accurate for our explorations. 

Completeness: Of the data that we need, which is the data of Illinois state, there are 215 rows of incomplete data. However, there are 1932 rows of data of illinois state, meaning that the incompleteness of the data we needed is only 10%. So, the completeness of this dataset is good for use. 

Timeliness: The dataset includes data from 2011 to 2023, which covers the years we want to investigate. 

Consistency: The consistency was checked by checking if there are any logic errors in the dataset, by checking whether there is Data_Value lower than Low_Confidence_LImit or higher than High_Confidence_Limit. After checking, there are no logic errors in the dataset. So the consistency of this dataset is good. 

Fit for use: Overall, this dataset is fit for use, but does require a little bit of cleaning, such as getting rid of the data of the states that we’re not interested in and also deal with the missing values.
