# Socioeconomic Factors and Access to Nutrition

### Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and obesity rates across counties in Illinois. By examining variables such as poverty rate, median household income, geographic location, and demographic composition, the analysis seeks to uncover patterns that link economic and social conditions to disparities in food access and nutritional health. Understanding these relationships can provide insights into how structural inequities influence health outcomes and inform targeted interventions to promote healthier communities across the state.

### Research Question(s)

How do different socioeconomic factors in Illinois, such as location, poverty rate, median income, and overall demographics, relate to the population's food access and nutritional health?

### Datasets

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. Food Environment Atlas. https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads


This dataset is known as the Food Environment Atlas, and includes several different sheets/categories, covering: ‘Access and Proximity to Foodstore’, ‘Store Availability’, ‘Restaurant Availability’, ‘Food Assistance’, ‘State Food Insecurity’, ‘Food Taxes’, ‘Local Foods’, ‘Health and Physical Activity’, and ‘Socioeconomic Characteristics’. This dataset provides a wide overview of these characteristics across the U.S., including specific states and counties. Additionally, the dataset was last updated in July of 2025, so it is quite up to date. This dataset also seems to heavily focus on impoverished communities and demographics. As for the criteria of low income for this dataset, their definition comes from the Department of the Treasury’s New Markets Tax Credit program, in which the median household income would be less than or equal to 80% of the state-wide median household income. Another large focus of the dataset, aside from low-income households, would be low-access households. These are based on resident's distance to their closest good food retailer(s). Overall, this dataset proves to be a useful tool, offering several different categories of measurement and data relating to nutrition and food accessibility. This dataset would help greatly in our goal of mapping relationships between different socioeconomic factors and nutrition/food accessibility.


Economic Research Service (ERS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Food Access Research Atlas, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/


This dataset includes information about food access data, with specific features such as location (by state and county), population, housing, income, and overall demographics (including race and age). These features relate to different food access metrics in the dataset, mainly low access metrics, along with the different demographics. This dataset is very similar to the previous dataset, just with a few more features. A very similar dataset can be found under the ‘Access and Proximity to Foodstore’ category sheet in the previous dataset, but this one in specific includes more information as it has more rows.


Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2025, September 16). Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data.CDC.gov. https://data.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7/about_data


This dataset is sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and includes information, ranging from the years 2011 to 2023, about adults’ diets throughout the United States. The dataset includes many other personal and socioeconomic features such as physical activity, weight status, age, income, race, location, and more. All of these factors would greatly aid in the analysis of how socioeconomic and self-care factors affect personal health behaviors. This dataset would be valuable in our research on finding how differences in health behaviors can potentially stem from community, upbringing, and demographics.


National Obesity by State. (2024, November 22). National Obesity Percentages by State. Catalog.Data.gov. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-obesity-by-state-d765a


This dataset includes every state along with its obesity rate percentage. Although it is quite a small and general dataset, it is useful to look at these statistics at a more holistic level. It covers the obesity rate in all states at the time of its recording, so it could also be interesting to compare the statistics here to the more detailed level statistics of obesity in the other, previous datasets.

### Constraints

1. The study focuses on Illinois counties only, so the findings may not be applicable for other states or regions.
2. The analysis can identify associations between socioeconomic factors and nutritional health, but cannot draw any causal relationships.

### Gaps
